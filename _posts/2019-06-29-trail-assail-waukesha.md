Race time: 57:14

This was my first really HOT temperature race. My first trail race too. I ended up finishing 23rd out of 85 and 6th in my age division (40-44). Though it didn't get into the 80s until the race was complete, the humidity was there.

Headed out from my place to pick up Coach Mom at about 5:00 AM. Race start time was at 8 and about 2 hours away. Usually a decaf drinker, my mom provided ample conversation after sharing my eye twitchingly dense pour over with her. 

The hazy fog was a harbinger of a muggy day. The sun shot beams through it as we headed east.

We arrived at Fox River Park in Waukesha an hour before start time. I did some warm up walks and jogs and felt the heat increase as the sun cooked off the remaining fog. A little bit before my race started, a kids race was run. One boy in blue dominated. Lets hope he uses his super powers for good.

"These are for after the race, but OK" said the man at the Anytime Fitness booth as he reluctantly handed me a warm bottle of water. My mom and I were thirsty and I'd left my water bottle at home.

At line up time I held my hand to my heart as they played the national anthem. The first instrumental one I've heard since I started running races, although vocal accompaniment was provided by a gentleman to my left. Thankfully his pitch was OK.

This was a chip timed, well sponsored race. So there was an official announcer, P.A. system and all of that. I bring that up because after the anthem came an awkward few minutes when the announcer tells everyone to "get in their spot", ie. if you're slow, get in the back. Fast people up front. Watching people shift around during this time is always amusing. I stayed put.

And then we were off. No gun.

The trail wound around the park. Sometimes in field, sometimes in woods. A few paved paths thrown in too. A little muddy in areas, and enough hills to make myself dig deep, especially towards the end. Both 5k and 10k races started at the same time with the same route. The 10k simply being two laps.

In previous races, I'd pass the water stations. This time I stopped at 3. With the humid heat I do not regret doing this.

I ended at a strong pace. Having just ran the same path, I knew when it was almost over.

After crossing the finish line, I clumsily tried stopping my Strava with sweaty hands. Within a few minutes the exhaustion lifted as quickly as the morning fog and I scarfed down post race treats feeling exhilarated!
