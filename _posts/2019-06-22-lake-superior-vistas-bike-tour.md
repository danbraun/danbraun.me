Looking around [online](https://www.bikeacentury.com/wisconsin/){:target="_blank"} I found my first cycling event, the [Superior Vistas Bike Tour](https://www.superiorvistas.org/){:target="_blank"}. There were multiple routes to choose from ranging from 19 to 100 miles in distance. I chose the 70 mile route. It'd be the longest ride I've ever embarked on, though safely within my current abilities. 100 will have to wait.

This was not a race but a ride, with many rest stops and lots of food. To take advantage of all the amenities on offer, it was recommended to start at around 8 in the morning. The ride was in Bayfield County, which is about 5 hours north of my home. I decided to start my journey to this event the day before, on Friday, adding some stops and a camping night along the way.

Being into yoga, I found along the way a yoga studio called [The Yoga Room](http://www.theyogaroomec.com/){:target="_blank"} in Eau Clare. That Friday also happened to be summer solstice, the longest day of the year. This is also a big day for us yogis. That being the case, there was a special class I could drop into on Friday at The Yoga Room.

But before I could unroll my mat, I had to deal with a slight emergency... The night before leaving, I noticed a lower than usual pressure in my rear tire. I filled it up and checked it the next morning. Sure enough it had leaked quite a bit. I've yet to become handy with repairing tubeless tires, or tubed for that matter. So, with time to spare before yoga, I took the bike to a placed called "Shift" in Eau Clare. A coffee shop / bike shop combo. By the time I was done with yoga they'd "fixed" my tubeless tire by placing a tube into it. Problem solved (or so I thought :worried: )
