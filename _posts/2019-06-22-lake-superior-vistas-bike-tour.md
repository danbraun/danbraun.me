Looking around [online](https://www.bikeacentury.com/wisconsin/){:target="_blank"} I found my first cycling event, the [Superior Vistas Bike Tour](https://www.superiorvistas.org/){:target="_blank"}. There were multiple routes to choose from ranging from 19 to 100 miles in distance. I chose the 70 mile route. It'd be the longest ride I've ever embarked on, though safely within my current abilities. 100 will have to wait.

This was not a race but a ride, with many rest stops and lots of food. To take advantage of all the amenities on offer, it was recommended to start at around 8 in the morning. The ride was in Bayfield County, which is about 5 hours north of my home. I decided to start my journey to this event the day before, on Friday, adding some stops and a camping night along the way.

Being into yoga, I found along the way a yoga studio called [The Yoga Room](http://www.theyogaroomec.com/){:target="_blank"} in Eau Clare. That Friday also happened to be summer solstice, the longest day of the year. This is also a big day for us yogis. That being the case, there was a special class I could drop into on Friday at The Yoga Room.

But before I could unroll my mat, I had to deal with a slight emergency... The night before leaving, I noticed a lower than usual pressure in my rear tire. I filled it up and checked it the next morning. Sure enough it had leaked quite a bit. I've yet to become handy with repairing tubeless tires, or tubed for that matter. So, with time to spare before yoga, I took the bike to a bike shop called "Shift". A coffee shop / bike shop combo. By the time I was done with yoga they'd "fixed" my tubeless tire by placing a tube into it. Problem solved (or so I thought :worried: )

Before driving the rest of the way north I fished a trout stream near town I'd scoped out the night before, catching a few small brown trout the last of which with a dry mayfly imitation. It was much more exciting to me at the time that how that reads. :blush:

I arrived at my campsite at Prentice Park in Ashland a few hours later.

After setting up, I drove into town to find dinner which ended up being at a small restaurant called [2nd Street Bistro](https://www.facebook.com/Bistro54806/){:target="_blank"}. The waitress said they had 1 fish fry dinner left which triggered me to immediately order it. Service and food was excellent, and as an unexpected twist there was a man playing a harp. Not a harmonica harp but a harp harp. Those big things with the long strings. This added a layer of opulence to my deep fried cod.

But that wasn't enough for me this evening. A place called Kraven Frozen Yogurt lay waiting just down the block. Surely I needed more fuel for tomorrow's big ride?

With some daylight and frozen pistachio yogurt to burn, I walked Ashland's beautiful Waterfront Trail from Maslowski Beach to Ashland Marina, returning to the park as the sun went down.

Saturday, the next morning, I drove north clockwise around the bay to Washburn. The event would start soon at Thompson's West End Park, on the shore of Chequamegon Bay. Beforehand I indulged in another robust meal at the phenomenal [North Coast Coffee](https://www.northcoastcoffee.net/){:target="_blank"}. A fluffy, flakey bacon and egg croissant sandwich proceeded by some sort of chunky chocolate scone. All of coarse paired with fresh black coffee.

Back at the park, cyclists where registering or signing in, and the casually starting their ride. A group start was scheduled at 8 a.m. This didn't seem to really happen as I rode out at 8 to no apparent fanfare.

In any case, the ride started out under surprisingly pleasant weather conditions. The forecast up to the day proceeding warned of scattered thunderstorms. But the day was clear and sunny. What luck!

What luck. Except the whump, whump, whump I started noticing from my back tire. Maybe was just the road? Lots of freezing and thawing up in da nort woods after all. Later, about half way though the ride when I finally allowed myself to look during a rest stop, I noticed that a 5-6 inch area of my rear tire was stuck into the rim further than the rest of the tire. This is apparently a common problem when seating a tire. I would later fix it myself, but for the duration of my 5 hour ride, I would endure what seemed like riding on a dented rim. Oh well. I tried to think of it as a gentle massage to my perineum.

Whether or not you just Googled "perineum", the ride was mostly pleasant and finished feeling better than I'd expected! So now I have a 70 miler and my first organized cycling event in the bag. The summer is still young. Could I get a century accomplished yet this year?
