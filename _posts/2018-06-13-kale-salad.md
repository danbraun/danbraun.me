## Kale salad recipe  
 I'm growing a few varieties of kale but mostly curly and lacinato.

 Chop up your presumably clean kale like this. You be flicking around less dressing and sesame seeds by eating smaller leaf pieces.

The garlic, ginger, oil and everything else mixes easily in a small mason jar.

Mix using your hands. Like a man. You need to smoosh around the leaves to tenderize them a bit.

I toast my sesame seeds on a stainless steel pan and get them golden and fragrant.

Ingredients:

 - About 100 grams of kale
 - olive oil 1tbsp
 - sesame oil 1 tbsp
 - ginger, raw 1 inch, grated (diameter of your thumb)
 - garlic 1 clove smashed and minced
 - salt 1 tsp
 - honey 1 tbsp or stevia 1 tsp
 - soy sauce 1/8 cup
 - rice vinegar 2 tsp
 - lemon juice from 1/2 lemon
 - sesame seeds, toasted 1 tbsp

Whisk or shake together dressing ingredients and mix in with chopped kale. Mixing with your hands works best as the kale needs to be ruffed up a bit to improve their texture. When ready to serve, toast some sesame seeds and sprinkle on top of the salad. Crushing the seeds will release more flavor.

This salad keeps well in the fridge and improves overnight.

The dressing ingredients are interchangeable and approximate. Adjust to taste. The main idea is to mix some sweetness with acidy salty-ness while
