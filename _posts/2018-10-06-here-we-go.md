Its in the 90s today and humid. Life struggles to gain any momentum when the weather is like this. I don't have air 
conditioning in my house though I can escape to the basement if things get out of hand.

Yesterday started out being a productive morning with the lawn getting an overdue mowing before the heat really set in. 
My chickens had already produced 3 eggs by 1 PM. Those poor girls have got to be suffering in their thick feather 
coats.

I'm in a band called Say It Ain't Soul, and we played a show for a fund raising event that afternoon. The heat should had been at full power by then.
